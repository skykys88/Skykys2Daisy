# Skykys2Daisy
My Pure Data Patches/Firmware Collection for the Electrosmith Daisy Patch Submodule microcontroller.

The .pd patches are customized for the Patch.Init() platform, but are open for customization for other hardware with the open source under MIT license.

Each sub-library here will contain a .pd file, a .bin file after converting to daisy, and patch descriptions.

Please note that this library of custom firmware works fine with the Patch.Init() platform and the party that wishes to use this library must accept the risks of using 3rd party firmware, and the owner of this library is not responsible for any damages.

Have fun patching!
